Device-Tree bindings for Nexell's VPU driver

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be "nexell, nx-vpu"
- reg: Physical base address of the IP registers and length of memory mapped
       region.
- interrupts: The interrupt signals from the vpu.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries.

Optional properties:
- memory-region: from reserved memory binding: require one memory region.
  If the property is present, the kernel must be set reserved-memory in dts.
  and must be seletcted VIDEO_NEXELL_RESERVED_MEMORY in kernel configuration.
  If the property is not present, the kernel must be not selected
  VIDEO_NEXELL_RESERVED_MEMORY in kernel configuration.
  ( recommand to use memory-region )

Example:
vpu: vpu@25180000 {
	compatible = "nexell,nx-vpu";
	reg = <0x25180000 0x10000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 31 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
	clocks = <&cmu_mm CLK_MM_CODA960_AXI>,
		<&cmu_mm CLK_MM_CODA960_APB>,
		<&cmu_mm CLK_MM_CODA960_CORE>;
	clock-names = "vpu-clk-axi", "vpu-clk-apb", "vpu-clk-core";
	assigned-clocks = <&cmu_mm CLK_MM_CODA960_CORE>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <250000000>;
	status = "disabled";
};

- in the case of using reserved-memory
reserved-memory {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges;

	vpu_cma: region_vpu_cma {
		compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
		reusable;
		size = <0x8000000>;
		/* linux,cma-default; */
	};
};

&vpu {
	memory-region = <&vpu_cma>;
	status = "okay";
};

- in the case of unusing reserved-memory
&vpu {
	status = "okay";
};
