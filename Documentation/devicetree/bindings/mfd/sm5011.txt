Silicon Mitus SM5011 multi-function device

SM5011 is a multifunction device which can be operated as PMIC, RTC, 32kHz
clock provider and Watchdog reset timer. It is interfaced with a host
controller using i2c interface.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "sm,sm5011";
- reg : 0x47 which is the i2c slave address of PMIC block.
- interrupts : This i2c device has an IRQ line connected to the main SoC.
- interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.
- pinctrl-names: pinctrl name of the interrupt line, "default"
- pinctrl-0: specifies a pinctrl node of the interrupt line

Example:
	sm5011: sm5011-pmic@47 {
		compatible = "sm,sm5011";
		interrupt-parent = <&alive_0>;
		interrupts = <1 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pmic_irq>;
		reg = <0x47>;
	};
