Nexell I2S controller

Required Properties:

- compatible : should be one of the following.
   - nexell,nxp3220-i2s: for 8/16/24bit stereo I2S.
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- dmas: list of DMA controller phandle and DMA request line ordered pairs.
- dma-names: identifier string for each DMA request line in the dmas property.
  These strings correspond 1:1 with the ordered pairs in dmas.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
 - i2s : i2s core clock name for mclk
 - pclk : i2s internal clock controller
 - pll : i2s core clock's source clock for dynamic sample rate for s5pxx18 soc.
	 It is not used in nxp3220.

Optional Properties:
- pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control groups used for this controller.
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".
- frame-bit : Set frame bit. (16/24/32/48 fs)
- sample-rate : Set sample rate. (8000~192000hz),
		if set this can't dynamic sample rates
- external-mclk-frequency : set external mclk frequency to use in master mode
- supply-mclk-always : supply mclk ouput always (not disable mclk output).
- supply-lrck-always : supply lrck ouput always (not disable lrck output).

Example:

i2s0: i2s0@20078000 {
	compatible = "nexell,nxp3220-i2s";
	reg = <0x20780000 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&cmu CLK_I2S0_CORE>, <&cmu CLK_I2S0_APB>;
	clock-names = "i2s", "pclk";
	dmas = <&pdma0 5 &pdma0 4>;
	dma-names = "tx", "rx";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&i2s0_bus>;
	status = "disabled";
};
