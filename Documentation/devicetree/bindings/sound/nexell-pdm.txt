Nexell PDM controller

Required Properties:
- compatible : should be one of the following.
               nexell,nxp3220-pdm: for 16bit 4 channel pdm to pcm.

- reg: physical base address and size of the pdm registers map and
	pdm internal sram.
- reg-names: Should be "pdm" and "sram".
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
 - axi : pdm bus clock name
 - core : pdm internal clock controller and make strobe clock.
- interrupts: Interrupt specifier for the PDM Peripheral/DMA
- syscon: a pointer to the syscon node so we can access the syscon registers
	 to set the iis reference channels.
- pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control groups used for this controller.
 - pdm_strobe: output clock for external digital mic.
 - pdm_lr0: input data for pad 0's Left / Right channel
 - pdm_lr1: input data for pad 1's Left / Right channel
 - pdm_lr2: input data for pad 2's Left / Right channel
 - pdm_lr3: input data for pad 3's Left / Right channel
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".

Optional Properties:
- ref-iis: set iis reference channel number to synchronize with pdm data.
- ref-sample-rate: set iis's sample rate to synchronize with pdm data.
- sample-rate: pdm to pcm sample rate. support 8,16,32,48khz
- strobe-hz: the strobe clock frequency applied to mic.
- filter-coeff: pdm's filter coefficient nodes and values.
- select-pads: The PDM input channel is 8 channels (pdm_lr0/1/2/3),
               but the PDM operates only 4 channels with 2 pads,
	       you can select input pads number.
- assigned-core-freqeuncy: skip pdm core clock set, use default core clock.

Example:

pdm: pdm0@20c00000 {
	compatible = "nexell,nxp3220-pdm";
	#sound-dai-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0x20c00000 0x1000>, <0x20c04000 0x4000>;
	reg-names = "pdm", "sram";
	clocks = <&cmu CLK_PDM0_AXI>,
		<&cmu CLK_PDM0_CORE>;
	clock-names = "axi", "core";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 67 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
	pinctrl-0 = <&pdm_strobe>, <&pdm_lr0>, <&pdm_lr1>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	syscon = <&sys_reg_sys>;
	status = "disabled";
};

&pdm {
	sample-rate = <16000>;
	assigned-clocks = <&cmu CLK_PDM0_AXI>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <200000000>;
	status = "okay";
};
