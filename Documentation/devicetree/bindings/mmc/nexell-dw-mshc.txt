* Nexell NXP3220 specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
  Storage Host Controller

The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Nexell nxp3220 specific
extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be
	- "nexell,nxp3220-dw-mshc" : for controllers with nexell nxp3220.

* nexell,drive_shift : Output drive clock phase shift. range is 0 ~ 7
* nexell,sample_shift : Read sample clock phase shift. range is 0 ~ 7.

* clock-names: input names of clocks used by the controller:
  - "biu" - controller bus clock,
  - "ciu" - cortrpller out clock.

- clocks: phandles and specifiers for all clocks specified in "clock-names"
  property, in the same order, according to clock bindings documentation [2].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
[2] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txts

Nodes fot nexell clock timing value:
 - drive_dly, sample_dly : 1 step delay 1.2usec.
 - drive_shift, sample_shift :  1 step shuft 90 degree.

Optional properties:
- soc,tieoff : phandle to the tieoff control.
 use 8bit bus width ch2. Must set  1 NX_TIEOFF_MMC_8BIT Tieoff.

Example:
  The MSHC controller node can be split into two portions, SoC specific and
  board specific portions as listed below.
in dtsi:
	dw_mmc0: dw_mmc@26080000 {
		compatible = "nexell,nxp3220-dw-mshc";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 82 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x26080000 0x1000>;
		clock-frequency = <400000000>;
		clock-names = "biu", "ciu";
		clocks = <&cmu CLK_SDMMC0_AHB>,
		      <&cmu CLK_SDMMC0_CORE>;
		num-slots = <1>;
		bus-width = <8>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&mmc0_bus>;
		fifo-depth = <0x20>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
