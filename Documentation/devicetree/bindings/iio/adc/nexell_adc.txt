Nexell's Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)

The devicetree bindings are for the ADC driver written for Nexell's ADC.

When the sampling is done, interrupt is rised, and then read the value.
Please refer to the datasheet for more information.


Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "nexell,<chip>-adc"
    <chip> can be "s5p4418", "s5p6818", "nxp3220"
  - reg: Should contain ADC registers location and length
  - interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the ADC
  - clocks : From common clock bindings - handles to clocks specified in
        "clock-names" property, in the same order.
  - clock-names: From common clock bindings - list of clock input names used by
        ADC block. Should contain "adc"
  - sample_rate: ADC channel sampling rate. (Max 1MHz according to datasheet)
  - #io-channel-cells: <1> - As ADC has multiple outputs.
        For details about this, see:
            Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/iio-bindings.txt
  - touchscreen-enable: Enable the touchscreen feature on the adc controller.

Example:
	adc:adc@20600000 {
		compatible = "nexell,nxp3220-adc";
		reg = <20600000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 IRQ_ADC0_MODULE 0>;
		clocks = <&cmu CLK_ADC0_APB>;
		clock-names = "adc";
		sample_rate = <200000>;
		#io-channel-cells = <1>;
		touchscreen-enable;
	};
