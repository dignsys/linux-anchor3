Device-Tree bindings for Nexell's DRM and display control driver

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be "nexell,nxp3220-drm"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the multi layer controller's
       registers map and display sysnc controller's registers map.
- reg-names: Should be "mlc.0" and "dpc.0".
- interrupts: The interrupt signals from the display sync controller.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
 - axi : display bus clock name
 - clk_x1 : display X1 sync clock for the operation of a pixel unit
 - clk_x2 : display X2 sync clock for for pixel output.
- plane-names: multi layer's type and order ("primary", "video")

Optional Properties:
- back-color: top layer's background color
- color-key: video layer's color key value
- video-priority: video layer's priority (0: video/primary, 1:primary/video)
- color-key-disable: disable color-key at boot time
- alphablend-disable: disable alpha blend at boot time
- video-scale-hfilter-max: video layer's horizontal line filter enable max limit
                           value, if source image width is greater than or equal
			   this value, disable horizontal line filter.
			   If set to 0, it is automatically set.
- video-scale-vfilter-max: video layer's veritcal line filter enable max limit
                           value, if source image height is greater than or equal
			   this value, disable vertical line filter.
			   If set to 0, it is automatically set.

Example:

drm: drm@25140000 {
	compatible = "nexell,nxp3220-drm";
	reg = <0x25140000 0x1000>, <0x25140800 0x1000>;
	reg-names = "mlc.0", "dpc.0";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 38 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
	clocks = <&cmu_mm CLK_MM_DPC_AXI>,
		       <&cmu_mm CLK_MM_DPC_X1>,
		       <&cmu_mm CLK_MM_DPC_X2>;
	clock-names = "axi", "clk_x1", "clk_x2";
	plane-names = "primary", "video";
	status = "disabled";
};

&drm {
	status = "okay";
};
