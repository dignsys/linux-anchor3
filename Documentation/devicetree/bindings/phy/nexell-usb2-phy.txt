Nexell USB2 PHY
-----------------------

Required properties:
- compatible : should be one of the listed compatibles:
	 "nexell,nxp3220-usb2-phy"
- reg : a list of offset + length pairs
- #phy-cells : from the generic phy bindings, must be 1
- clocks and clock-names:
	- the "ahb" clock is required by the usb block modules, used as gate
	- the "apb" clock is required by the usb tieoff block, used as gate

Optional properties:
- otg,vbus-gpio: If present, specifies a gpio that needs to be activated for
	the bus to be powered.
- ehci,vbus-gpio: If present, specifies a gpio that needs to be activated for
	the bus to be powered.
- phy-supply: supply for USB phy

Example:

usb2phy: usb2phy@24030000 {
	compatible = "nexell,nxp3220-usb2-phy";
	reg = <0x24030000 0x200>;
	#phy-cells = <1>;
	clocks = <&cmu_usb CLK_USB_AHB>, <&cmu_usb CLK_USB_SYSREG_APB>;
	clock-names = "ahb", "apb";
};

&usb2phy {
        otg,vbus-gpio = <&gpio_c 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
        ehci,vbus-gpio = <&gpio_b 23 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
        status = "okay";
};
