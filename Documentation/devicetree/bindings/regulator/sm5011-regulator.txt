Binding for Silicon Mitus SM5011 regulators

This is a part of the device tree bindings of SM5011 multi-function device.
More information can be found in ../mfd/sm5011.txt file.

The SM5011 PMIC has 5 Buck converters and 20 LDOs that can be controlled
over I2C.

Following properties should be present in main device node of the MFD chip.

Optional node:
- enable-pwrstm : This boolean value enables PWRSTM feature.
- voltage-regulators : The regulators of sm5011 have to be instantiated
  under subnode named "voltage-regulators" using the following format.

	regulator_name {
		regulator-compatible = LDOn/BUCKn
		standard regulator constraints....
	};
	refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

  The regulator node's name should be initialized with a string
to get matched with their hardware counterparts as follow:

	-LDOn 	:	for LDOs, where n can be in range 1 to 20.
			example: LDO1, LDO2, LDO26.
	-BUCKn 	:	for BUCKs, where n can be in range 2 to 6.
			example: BUCK2, BUCK5, BUCK6.
  sub-node:
	- pwrstm-enter/exit-slot : This integer value indicates the on/off
slot when pmic enter/exit PWRSTM mode. It can be 0 to 3.(4 slots are supported)

Example:

	sm5011: sm5011-pmic@47 {
		compatible = "sm,sm5011";
		interrupt-parent = <&alive_0>;
		interrupts = <1 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pmic_irq>;
		reg = <0x47>;

		voltage-regulators {
			buck2_reg: BUCK2 {
				regulator-name = "VDD_CPU_1P0";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <562500>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <2150000>;
				regulator-always-on;
				regulator-boot-on;
				pwrstm-enter-slot = <3>;
				pwrstm-exit-slot = <0>;

				regulator-state-mem {
					regulator-off-in-suspend;
				};
			};

			ldo1_reg: LDO1 {
				regulator-name = "VDD_PLL0_1P0";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <800000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <3350000>;
				regulator-always-on;
				regulator-boot-on;
			};
		};
	};
