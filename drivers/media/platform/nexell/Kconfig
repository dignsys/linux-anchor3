	  This is a V4L2 driver for Nexell NXP3220 SoC camera host
	  interface. Nexell camera device has two memory interfaces, one is
	  clipper and other is decimator. clipper can crop source region
	  and decimator can scale down but cannot scale up.

	  Camera host interface has three physical interface with sensor.
	  Two of them are parallel and support ITU-R BT.656 and BT.601 and
	  BT.1120.
